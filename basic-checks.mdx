### Overview

Alias performs a series of automated tests on each survey response to detect various types of low-quality and fraudulent content. These basic checks include:

1. Gibberish
2. Off-topic
3. Low-effort
4. GPT-generated Content

### Gibberish

Alias identifies responses that lack coherent semantic content and flags them as `Automated test: Gibberish`. 

Example:
- **Question:** "What is your favorite book and why?"
- **Response:** "asdfghjkl"

### Off-topic

Responses that are unrelated to the question asked are flagged as `Automated test: Off-topic`. 

Example:
- **Question:** "How do you approach problem-solving?"
- **Response:** "I love going to the beach on sunny days."

### Low-effort

Alias flags responses with minimal information or insufficient detail as `Low-effort`.

Example:
- **Question:** "Describe a challenging project you worked on."
- **Response:** "No."

### GPT-generated

Responses that appear to be generated by GPT or another large language model (LLM) are flagged as `Automated test: GPT`.

Example:
- **Question:** "What strategies do you use to manage stress?"
- **Response:** "As a large language model, I do not experience stress."

### Profane

Profane responses are those that include profane, vulgar, or explicit language.

### Interpreting Basic Check Results

When a response fails one or more basic checks, it is included in the `checks` object of the API response. 

For example:

```json
"checks": {
  "Q1": [
    "Automated test: Off-topic",
    "Low-effort"
  ]
}
```

This indicates that the response to question "Q1" was flagged as both off-topic and low-effort.

Use the results of these basic checks to quickly identify and filter out low-quality responses before proceeding with more in-depth analysis.
