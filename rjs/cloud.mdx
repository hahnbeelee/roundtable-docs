Welcome to the Getting Started guide for **RoundtableJS** using Roundtable Cloud.

### Creating a New Survey

1. Navigate to [surveys.roundtable.ai](https://surveys.roundtable.ai)
2. Click on the `+ New Survey` button

### Basic Usage

In the Roundtable Cloud editor, you can create your survey using JavaScript. Here's a basic example:

```javascript
// RoundtableJS is already defined, so we can destructure the components we need
const { Survey, SingleSelect } = RoundtableJS;

// Create a new Survey instance
const survey = new Survey();

// Define the first question as a single-select question
const question1 = new SingleSelect({
    id: 'question1',
    text: 'A question',
    options: ['Option 1', 'Option 2'],
});

// Define the second question as a single-select question
const question2 = new SingleSelect({
    id: 'question2',
    text: 'A second question',
    options: ['Option 1', 'Option 2'],
});

// Define the survey logic
async function runSurvey() {
    // Show the first page with the first question
    await survey.showPage({ id: 'page1', elements: [question1] });
    
    console.log('Page 1 completed');
    
    // Show the next page with the second question
    await survey.showPage({ id: 'page2', elements: [question2] });
    
    // Finish the survey
    survey.finishSurvey();
}

// Start the survey
runSurvey();
```

<Tip>Roundtable Cloud automatically handles survey deployment and responses for you.</Tip>

### HTML Structure

Roundtable Cloud uses the following HTML structure for surveys:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Survey</title>
    <style>
        * {
            box-sizing: border-box;
        }
        .hidden {
            display: none;
        }
    </style>
    <script src="https://fpjscdn.net/v3/1jGWJFXzumuzHH3H5IqI/iife.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="survey-container" class="hidden">
        <div id="page-container"></div>
        <div id="navigation">
            <button id="next-button">Next</button>
        </div>
        <div id="finish"></div>
    </div>
    <script>
        window.RUNNING_CONTEXT = 'production';
        const surveyId = '';
    </script>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/roundtable-js@0.1.2/dist/bundle.js"></script>
    <script src="https://surveys.roundtable.ai//js/extendedRoundtableJS.js"></script>
    <!-- Your survey code will go here -->
</body>
</html>
```

### Data Quality (Enterprise)

Roundtable Cloud Enterprise offers advanced data quality features to ensure the integrity of your survey responses.

#### Device Fingerprinting

Every survey response includes the following metadata:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Start time | str | ISO 8601 string representing when the survey page was first loaded (in UTC) |
| Browser language | str | Primary language of the user's browser |
| End time | str | ISO 8601 string representing when the finishSurvey() method was called (in UTC) |
| Response ID | str | Unique string identifier for the survey session |
| Fingerprint ID | str | Unique identifier for the participant stable within and across surveys |
| IP address country | str | Detected country based on the participant's IP address |
| Is bot | bool | Indicates whether the client is an automated script (true) or human (false) |
| Using VPN | bool | Indicates whether the participant is using a VPN |
| Using incognito | bool | Indicates whether the participant is in incognito/private browsing mode |
| Browser tampering | bool | Indicates whether we detected browser tampering |
| Using virtual machine | bool | Indicates whether the browser is running in a virtual machine |

<Note>
The following fields are always added regardless of the plan:
- Start time
- End time
- Response ID
</Note>

#### Open-end Analysis

[Roundtable Alias](https://docs.roundtable.ai/overview) is automatically added to every `OpenEnd` question, unless `includeAlias` for that open-end is set to false.

**Global Data**

If Alias is run (i.e., number of tracked open ends â‰¥ 1), the following is added to every response:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Alias flagged | bool | Indicates whether any checks failed |
| Alias error | bool | Indicates if there was an error in processing the request |
| Alias num checks failed | int | A counter for how many checks failed across all tracked questions |
| Alias model | str | Specifies which Alias model was run |

**Per-Question Data**

For each tracked open-end question, the following is added:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| [questionId] Alias flags | str | A string list of any failed checks for that question |
| [questionId] Alias response group | int | An integer value representing a response cluster of duplicated responses |
| [questionId] Alias effort | int | An integer, 0-10, indicating the effort score of the response (higher values correspond to higher effort) |

<Note>
Alias tracks a maximum of 6 open-end questions. If more than 6 are given, it runs on the first 6 open-ends.
</Note>

By leveraging these data quality features, you can ensure the reliability and validity of your survey responses.

### Deployment

Once you've created your survey in the Roundtable Cloud editor:

1. Click `Publish survey` to make your survey live

Roundtable Cloud will provide you with a unique URL for your survey, which you can share with participants.
