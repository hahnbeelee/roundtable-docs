Welcome to RoundtableJS, an open-source survey programming library designed for developers, researchers, and businesses.

**Surveys are a _craft_**. They are the gateways to new information.  We believe that well-crafted surveys lead to better data, and better data leads to more informed decisions.

### Our Story

For the past year, we've been building products in the survey industry. We started with an AI-powered survey simulation tool, and then an API for detecting fraudulent survey responses.

We realized there was an opportunity to address larger issues in the ecosystem. Developers and researchers want a DIY platform that gives them full control over the survey experience. Surveys are a *craft*. Their creators want the ability to customize every aspect, from question logic to user interface, without the constraints of limited tools.

We are excited to introduce **RoundtableJS**, a comprehensive JavaScript library that provides the functionality to code programmatic surveys at scale. By allowing people to fully customize them for today’s distribution channels, we hope people will design better, more engaging surveys.

### Key Features

- **Designed for the Modern Web**: We’re designed in JavaScript and leverage its asynchronous functionality for managing survey logic. For example, rather than determining this logic based on callbacks that trigger when a page is submitted, our library builds the timeline in an async function which means the logic flows intuitively from top to bottom. Read more about why we chose asynchronous logic [here](logic).

- **Developer-Friendly**: We are open-source and API-first. This problem arose by seeing how difficult it was to integrate our API into other survey softwares. We want the open-source offering to include a robust plugin ecosystem where people can introduce new question types, integrate with tools like CRMs, and control how data is stored and processed. Check out our [contributing guidelines](contribution) and start creating your own plugin today.

- **AI-Native Functionality**: Our [cloud offering](https://www.roundtable.ai) has AI-native features such as natural language programming and automated fraud detection. We're continuously expanding our AI features. Let us know what tools you'd like to see!
