## Philosophy

The core philosophy of RoundtableJS revolves around three main principles:

1. **Modularity**: The library is designed with a component-based architecture, allowing you to build complex surveys from simple, reusable parts. Alternatively, leverage our customized copilot in our [cloud offering](surveys.roundtable.ai) to program in natural language.

2. **Ease of Styling**: Every aspect of your survey can be styled using intuitive CSS-like objects, giving you complete control over the look and feel of your surveys. Design is an underrated part of the survey experience that can greatly enhance data quality.

3. **Intuitive Timeline Management**: RoundtableJS uses an asynchronous approach to page rendering, making it easy to create complex survey flows and logic. In other libraries survey logic is determined via callbacks that trigger when a page is submitted, which quickly becomes a nightmare to manage and debug.

## How RoundtableJS Works

### Survey Constructor

The foundation of every RoundtableJS survey is the Survey constructor. This JavaScript class is used to create new survey instances:

```javascript
const { Survey } = RoundtableJS;

const survey = new Survey({
    condition: 'control',
    participant_id: 'user123',
    styles: {
        container: {
            maxWidth: '800px',
            padding: '20px',
        },
        button: {
            backgroundColor: 'blue',
            color: 'white',
        }
    }
});
```

### Elements

Elements in RoundtableJS define different question types. These are also JavaScript classes, each representing a specific type of survey question or content:

```javascript
const { TextInput, SingleSelect, HTML } = RoundtableJS;

const nameQuestion = new TextInput({
    id: 'name',
    text: 'What is your name?',
    required: true,
    placeholder: 'Enter your name',
});

const colorQuestion = new SingleSelect({
    id: 'favoriteColor',
    text: 'What is your favorite color?',
    options: ['Red', 'Blue', 'Green', 'Yellow'],
});

const welcomeMessage = new HTML({
    id: 'welcome',
    content: '<h1>Welcome to our survey!</h1>'
});
```

### Pages

Pages in RoundtableJS are built out of arrays of elements. They are shown asynchronously, allowing for complex survey logic:

```javascript
await survey.showPage({
    id: 'introPage',
    elements: [
        welcomeMessage,
        nameQuestion,
        colorQuestion
    ]
});
```

### Plugins

Plugins allow you to modify the logic or content of the survey across pages. They provide a way to add global functionality to your survey:

```javascript
const myPlugin = new MyCustomPlugin({
    // plugin configuration
});

survey.use(myPlugin);
```

### Styling

All surveys, elements, and plugins in RoundtableJS accept an optional `styles` dictionary. This allows you to modify the CSS of any part of the survey using a JavaScript object:

```javascript
const styledQuestion = new TextInput({
    id: 'email',
    text: 'What is your email address?',
    styles: {
        question: {
            color: 'darkblue',
            fontSize: '18px'
        },
        input: {
            borderColor: 'lightblue'
        }
    }
});
```
