Welcome to the Getting Started guide for **RoundtableJS**. This guide covers development and the basics, but for more advanced features, be sure to explore the rest of our documentation.

<Tip>If you have any questions, join and ask our [community](https://github.com/roundtableAI/roundtable-js).</Tip>

### Installation

#### Option 1: npm

Use `npm` to install **RoundtableJS**:

```bash
npm install roundtable-js
```

After installation, you can import the necessary modules:

```javascript
import Survey from 'roundtable-js/library/core/survey.js';
import SingleSelect from 'roundtable-js/library/elements/singleSelect.js';
```

#### Option 2: CDN

Use a CDN by adding the following script tag to your HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello World</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/roundtable-js@0.0.3-beta.0/dist/bundle.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

When using the CDN version, you don't need to import modules as they will be globally available.

### Basic Usage

Create a simple survey by defining the questions and then the logic:

```javascript
// Define an asynchronous function to run the survey
async function runSurvey() {

    // Create a new Survey instance with a specific participant ID
    const survey = new Survey({ participantId: 'participant_123' });

    // Define the first question as a single-select question with two options
    const question1 = new SingleSelect({
        id: 'question1',
        text: 'A question',
        options: ['Option 1', 'Option 2'],
    });

    // Define the second question as a single-select question with two options
    const question2 = new SingleSelect({
        id: 'question2',
        text: 'A second question',
        options: ['Option 1', 'Option 2'],
    });
    
    // Show the first page with the first question and wait for it to be answered
    await survey.showPage({ id: 'page1', elements: [question1] });
    
    // This code runs only after the first page is completed
    console.log('Page 1 completed');
    
    // Show the next page with the second question and wait for it to be answered
    await survey.showPage({ id: 'page2', elements: [question2] });
    
    // Finish the survey once all pages are completed
    survey.finishSurvey();
}

// Start the survey by calling the runSurvey function
runSurvey();
```

<Tip> Roundtable leverages JavaScript's ```await/async``` functionality for timeline management. For a deeper understanding why we did this, read our [Logic](logic) page. </Tip>

### Deployment

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>RoundtableJS Survey</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="survey-container"></div>
    <script type="module" src="your-survey-script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Set up your HTML and deploy on a local server, e.g. `python3 -m http.server 8080`.
