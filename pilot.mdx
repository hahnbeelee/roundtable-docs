#### 1. Collect data and format

Run your survey, storing the `question_history` for each participant's open-ended question they complete.

#### 2. Call the API

Call the API using our [endpoints](api-reference/v011). *Note: We recommend waiting at least 5 seconds between each API call as we work to scale.*

#### Example Usage

```python
import requests

url = "https://roundtable.ai/api/alias/latest"

payload = {
    "questions": {},
    "question_histories": {},
    "responses": {},
    "survey_id": "<string>",
    "participant_id": "<string>"
}
headers = {
    "api_key": "<api_key>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.request("POST", url, json=payload, headers=headers)

print(response.text)
```
