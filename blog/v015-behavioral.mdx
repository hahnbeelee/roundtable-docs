We are unbelievably excited to announce the release of [Alias v015](../api-reference/v015), a significant update that improves our ability to identify and prevent survey fraud.

As Roundtable continues to scale and grow, we have become increasingly aware of emerging sources of survey fraud. For this update, we have substantially enhanced our behavioral tracking functionality, with a particular focus on improving programmatic response detection.

### Typing behavior analysis

One of the key features of Alias v015 is the introduction of the *Typing* column in your survey dashboard. This new column displays the participant's typing behavior throughout their open-end response.

Our algorithms analyze this typing data and distinguishes between genuine human input and suspicious bot-like activity. By examining factors such as typing speed, rhythm, and patterns, we can accurately identify programmatic responses and flag them for further review or automatic disqualification.

Above are two examples of a suspicious vs. non-suspicious bot. Can you look at the graphs and guess which is which?

### Staying ahead of survey fraud

As Roundtable continues to grow and attract a larger user base, we remain committed to staying one step ahead of emerging sources of survey fraud. The enhancements introduced in Alias v015 demonstrate our dedication to providing our clients with the most advanced and reliable tools for ensuring data quality and integrity.

The Alias v015 update targets a new sophisticated form of bot: one that bypasses traditional copy/paste filters, and instead enters text character-by-character in an oscillatory pattern to mimic human typing. With our growing scale, we are able to identify this cluster of fraudulent activity and prevent it from entering your survey.

As we like to say at Roundtable, survey fraud detection is a cat-and-mouse game. Increasingly sophisticated fraudulent actors will continue to bypass security measures. It is our full-time job to identifiy and mitigate these threats, so that you can be confident in the data you have gathered.

We encourage you to explore the new *Typing* column in your survey dashboard and experience the benefits of our enhanced behavioral tracking firsthand. If you have any questions or feedback, our support team is always ready to assist you.

Together, let's continue to build trust in online research and unlock the full potential of your survey data with Roundtable and Alias v015.
