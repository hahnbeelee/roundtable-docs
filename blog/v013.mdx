We're excited to announce [Alias v013](../api-reference/v013) after great feedback from our customers. The major change has been decomposing the previous **Junk** flag to **Gibberish**, **Off-topic**, and **Low-effort**. Now with this advanced junk detector, researchers can be extremely precise when automating their data cleaning process.

We ran v013 on [our MTurk study](turk) below. Each panel shows the results of one 100-person survey.

We see a slight rise in human participants as minimum HIT rate increases, as well as a near complete elimination of 'junk' responses at the highest tier.

Sample answers from each [flag](api-reference/v013) are below. Question: What comes to your head when you think about Boston? Please give specific examples.

- **Human:** The fact that it is located in the Northeast of the country. Boston has a baseball team called the RedSox as well. I also know that Boston is close to New York and other northeast states.

- **Low-effort:** Good

- **Off-topic:** Psychology is the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists are actively involved in studying and understanding mental processes, brain functions, and behavior and feel good in the view

- **Gibberish:** Let's take some examples to understand this better. You can target ... Then, it comes into your head as your own thoughts but they are not your

- **GPT:** When I think of Boston, several things come to mind:

  - Historical Significance: Boston is rich in American history, particularly associated with the American Revolution. Examples include the Freedom Trail, Boston Tea Party Ships & Museum, and landmarks like the Paul Revere House and Bunker Hill Monument.

  - Education and Universities: Boston is renowned for its numerous prestigious universities and colleges, such as Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Boston University, and Northeastern University...

We found **Junk** was too big of a catch-all, precisely because researchers have different exclusion criteria when it comes to tags like **Low-effort**. In addition to better junk flags, v013 provides better GPT detection, more sensitive behavioral analyses, and faster speed.
