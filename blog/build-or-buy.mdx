---

Today, online surveys have become an essential tool to gather valuable insights and make data-driven decisions. However, the increasing prevalence of survey fraud and bot activity poses a significant threat to the data's accuracy and reliability. To combat this issue, companies must choose between building an in-house solution or purchasing a third-party API like Roundtable. In this blog post, we'll explore the pros and cons of each approach to help you make an informed decision.

## Building an In-House Solution
#### Advantages
- **Flexibility and Customization:** Developing an in-house survey fraud and bot detection system allows you to tailor the solution to your company's specific needs and workflow. This level of customization ensures seamless integration with your existing processes.
- **Expertise and Development:** Building an in-house solution can be leveraged as a strategic asset, and the knowledge gained during development can be resold to end clients, providing an additional revenue stream.
#### Challenges
- **Time and Cost:** Creating an initial solution can be expensive and time-consuming. You may need to hire external talent, which adds to the overall cost of development.
- **Maintenance and Ongoing Development:** New forms of fraud and bot activity emerge regularly, requiring continuous updates to the underlying algorithms. Maintaining an in-house solution demands ongoing resources and expertise.
- **Resource Intensive:** Developing and maintaining an in-house system requires significant personnel and financial resources. The opportunity cost of not allocating these resources to other valuable business opportunities can be high.
## Purchasing a Third-Party API (like Roundtable)
#### Advantages
- **Speed to Deploy:** Third-party APIs, such as Roundtable, can be set up in less than 30 minutes, delivering instant ROI. This is a significant advantage compared to the months it may take to develop an in-house solution.
- **Expertise and Support:** Vendors like Roundtable have specialized teams of experts who can quickly adapt their techniques to address new threats and provide guidance when needed.
- **Scalability and Reliability:** Third-party providers process millions of survey participants daily and have the necessary infrastructure to handle this volume, freeing up cost resources that would otherwise be required for in-house development.
- **Compliance and Security:** Market research software firms routinely handle sensitive data and comply with international data security standards, ensuring your data remains secure.
#### Challenges
- **Limited Customization:** While APIs like Roundtable are designed to be flexible and compatible with any software, there are limitations to the level of customization that can be accommodated.
- **Limited Visibility and Control:** When purchasing a third-party solution, buyers have limited understanding of the proprietary algorithms used to detect fraud, which may be a concern for some companies.
## Conclusion
Choosing between building an in-house survey fraud and bot detection system or purchasing a third-party API depends on your company's specific needs, resources, and priorities. While an in-house solution offers flexibility and customization, it comes with significant time, cost, and resource challenges. On the other hand, third-party APIs like Roundtable provide expertise, scalability, and rapid deployment, making them an attractive option for businesses looking to protect their survey data quickly and effectively.
