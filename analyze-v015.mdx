## Interpreting the API Response

The Roundtable Alias API returns a JSON object containing detailed fraud analysis results for each survey response. Key components include:

- `flagged`: A boolean indicating if the response is suspected of fraud.
- `num_checks_failed`: The number of fraud detection checks the response failed.
- `effort_ratings`: A granular assessment of the effort put into each response (1-10 scale).
- `checks`: The specific fraud detection checks failed by each response.

```json
{
  "error": false,
  "flagged": true,
  "num_checks_failed": 1,
  "response_groups": {
    "Q1": 1
  },
  "effort_ratings": {
    "Q1": 4
  },
  "checks": {
    "Q1": [
      "Automated test: Off-topic"
    ]
  },
  "model": "alias-v015"
}
```

## Effort Ratings

The `effort_ratings` object provides an effort score (1-10) for each response, helping you gauge the thoughtfulness and substance of participant answers. Use these ratings to:

- Quickly identify low-effort responses for review or removal
- Analyze the distribution of effort across your survey
- Correlate effort with other response attributes or participant segments

## Fraud Detection Checks

The `checks` object lists the specific fraud signals triggered by each response, such as:

- `Low-effort`: The response lacks sufficient detail or substance
- `Automated test: Off-topic`: The response is irrelevant to the question asked
- `GPT paste artifacts`: The response contains formatting common in AI-generated text
- `Cross-duplicate response`: The response is suspiciously similar to another participant's answer

Leverage these granular checks to understand the types of fraud detected and investigate suspicious responses in context.

## Customizing Thresholds

Tailor Alias to your specific use case by adjusting the `low_effort_threshold` parameter. This threshold (1-10) determines the effort rating below which a response is flagged as low quality. 

Set a higher threshold to detect only the most egregious low-effort responses, or a lower threshold to cast a wider net. Strike the right balance for your survey goals and tolerance for false positives.

## Integration and Next Steps
