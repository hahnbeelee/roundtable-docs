Roundtable Alias is an AI-powered API that analyzes open-ended survey responses to identify fraudulent, low-quality, and bot-generated content.

### Key Features

- **Comprehensive Fraud Detection**: Alias employs a multi-layered approach to detect various types of fraudulent responses, including gibberish, off-topic, low-effort, and AI-generated content.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Advanced behavioral tracking capabilities monitor participants' typing patterns and keystroke dynamics to identify suspicious activities and bot-like behavior.
- **Duplicate Detection**: Alias uses text similarity algorithms to flag duplicate and near-duplicate responses within and across participants.
- **Effort Scoring**: Each response receives a granular effort score between 1 and 10, helping you assess the level of engagement and thoughtfulness in participant answers.
- **Seamless Integration**: With a simple API endpoint and well-documented libraries, Alias can be easily integrated into any survey platform or custom data pipeline.
