# Roundtable Alias API Documentation

Welcome to the Roundtable Alias API documentation. Roundtable Alias is a powerful API designed to analyze web and user behavior to open-end survey responses. By identifying and flagging common bot patterns, it streamlines data cleaning and fraud detection processes, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of your survey data.

## Quickstart

Getting started with Roundtable Alias is straightforward. Use the following curl command to make API requests:


``` bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://roundtable.ai/api/alias/v014 \

  --data '{
  "participant_id": "participant_123",
  "questions": {
    "Q1": "How do you feel our software has impacted your daily workflow?"
  },
  "responses": {
    "Q1": "I really like pineapple on pizza."

## Content vs. Behavioral Analyses
When it comes to detecting survey fraud and bot activity, there are two primary approaches: content analyses and behavioral analyses.

### Content Analyses
Content analyses focus on the textual content of survey responses. They involve examining the language, grammar, and semantics of the responses to detect patterns indicative of fraudulent or bot-generated responses. Content analyses can identify:
- Suspicious keywords and phrases
- Repetitive or templated responses
- Nonsensical or irrelevant answers

### Behavioral Analyses
Behavioral analyses concentrate on the behavioral patterns exhibited by respondents during survey completion. They can detect:
- Unusual typing speed
- Programmatically entered text
- (Upcoming) Identical response patterns from multiple participants
- (Upcoming) IP address and geolocation inconsistencies

By combining both content and behavioral analyses, Roundtable Alias provides comprehensive fraud detection capabilities, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of your survey data.
